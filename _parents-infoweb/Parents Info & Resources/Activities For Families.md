#### Mother Tongue Language Symposium 2017

The Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (MTLS) 2017 is an annual event co-organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Mother Tongue Language Learning and Promotion Committees (MTLLPCs), with the support from Early Childhood Development Agency, the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism (LKYFB), Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) and National Library Board (NLB). 

  

The theme for MTLS 2017 is “Flourish in the Wonderland of Our Languages”. It focuses on how children learn, grow and thrive in a vibrant and immersive environment and develop a keen sense of wonderment for our Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), as well as family-centred and community driven efforts to create a nurturing and vibrant MTL learning environment. Children will discover engaging and meaningful MTL learning experiences beyond the classroom context. Targeted at parents, educators, MTL academia and the general public, the event will feature 30 sharing sessions and workshops, 43 exhibition booths by pre-school centres, schools and community partners, as well as language activities and performances. Please see the poster for more details.

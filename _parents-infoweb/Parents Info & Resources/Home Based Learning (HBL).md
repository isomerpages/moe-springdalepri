The Curriculum Continuity Plan focuses on how the school can facilitate students’ learning should there be a need for students to stay at home for a period of time in the event of an unscheduled school closure. 

To minimize the loss of curriculum time and to keep students gainfully occupied at home, there is a need to have a Home-Based Learning (HBL) plan.

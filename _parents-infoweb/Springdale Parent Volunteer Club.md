**Welcome to Springdale Parent Volunteer Club (SPVC)!**

As a Parent Volunteer (PV), you will be working with the school to **promote a vibrant learning community** for our children. Whether you are a homemaker or a busy professional, there are always opportunities for you to contribute your skills, effort and time to enhance our children’s learning experiences.

Here are some upcoming events that require PVs’ support:


##### Activities in Term 4 (2019)

This is the first year that SPVC organised a carnival for students during Children’s Day celebration. Game booths were set up and students were immersed in the carnival mood. The kids had fun playing the games and collecting points to exchange for gifts during their recess time.

**Teachers’ Day Performance**  

**5 Sept 2019**

Teachers are the light guiding the students in a world of possibilities. This year, PVs, together with some of the P6 students, put up a song item using glow sticks. Although the hall was dark, it did not deter the rest of the students from joining in the singing. PVs ended the performance by thanking the teachers in 4 languages (Malay, Tamil, Chinese and English).

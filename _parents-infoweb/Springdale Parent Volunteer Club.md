#### a. School Events

**Teacher's Day Performance**

PVs, together with some of the P6 students, put up a song item using glow sticks. Although the hall was dark, it did not deter the rest of the students from joining in the singing. PVs ended the performance by thanking the teachers in 4 languages (Malay, Tamil, Chinese and English).


##### b. Bonding Activities

**Festive Celebration**  

PVs come together during festive occasions to celebrate. For example, during Deepavali, PVs came together to learn how to make light ornament using paper and string. They also had hands-on session of making Rangoli and learning the techniques from our Indian parent volunteers to make the perfect Rangoli. 

**Hari Raya Aidilfitri**

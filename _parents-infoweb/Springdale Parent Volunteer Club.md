**Teachers’ Day Performance**  

**5 Sept 2019**

Teachers are the light guiding the students in a world of possibilities. This year, PVs, together with some of the P6 students, put up a song item using glow sticks. Although the hall was dark, it did not deter the rest of the students from joining in the singing. PVs ended the performance by thanking the teachers in 4 languages (Malay, Tamil, Chinese and English).

Welcome to&nbsp;**Springdale Parent Volunteer Club**!

As depicted in the 3-leaves clover on our school crest, education is a partnership between the&nbsp;**home, school and community**.

**Children’s Day Carnival Proposal**

**3 Oct 2019**

This is the first year that SPVC organised a carnival for students during Children’s Day celebration. Game booths were set up and students were immersed in the carnival mood. The kids had fun playing the games and collecting points to exchange for gifts during their recess time.

**P6 Post PSLE activity- I CAN!**  

**8 - 10 and 18 Oct 2019**

The time for parent volunteers to be “teachers” is back again!  This is the second year that the P6 students were taught with some basic life skills. Through the enrichment programme organised by our parent volunteers, the kids learnt some tips on sewing, ironing, washing and folding of their own clothes in their daily life.

The Gymnastics CCA aims to provide students the platform to discover and learn various body movements with control as well as develop confidence in what their body is capable of performing. Individual activities conducted seek to develop mastery-orientation of movements in students and character values such as confidence, responsibility, resilience and sportsmanship. Group activities allow development of friendships and social integration to forge a greater sense of identity and belonging to the CCA.

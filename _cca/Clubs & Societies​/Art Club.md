The Art Club CCA aims to nurture and aspire students with artistic flair and interest to create meaningful art. It will also be a channel for them to echo their voices in communicating and expressing self, time and places. Through the art making processes, students will sharpen foundational and creativity skills while exploring and experimenting with varied art media and materials. Mounting on the different platforms to extract their inherent talent in art, students will develop self-confidence and competency to share their love for the art, and utilise it as an avenue to contribute to the school/community. Through the experiences, students will learn the importance of values, such as responsibility, resilience, care and respect.

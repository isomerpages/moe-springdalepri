<h3>Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)</h3>
<p>As part of the school’s Co-Curriculum Programmes (CCP) to support the
holistic development of students, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are designed
to develop students’ Attitudes, Skills and Knowledge (ASK) in the cognitive,
physical and aesthetics domains. CCA will also provide a common space for
friendships and social integration which develop students’ sense of identity
and belonging to the school.</p>
<p>The objectives of CCA are to:&nbsp;
<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide students with a platform to discover their
interests and talents.
<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop specific ASK in students pertaining to the
CCA.
<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop character and social-emotional competencies
as students interact with one another.</p>
<p>Please note that P6 students will not be involved in CCA in Sem 2 (except
for selected students in the school team) and the P3 students will be coming
on board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The CCA offered are based on a number of considerations:
<br>&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Breadth of learning experiences of each student.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Available facilities and resources
<br>&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Providing varied domains of CCA to cater to various interests
<br>&nbsp;4.&nbsp; Staff strength and manpower resources</p>
<p>Important points to note</p>
<p>CCA will take place after school on either Monday, Tuesday or Thursday.
CCA will start from 2.45pm to 4.45pm. Dates and other relevant information
will be sent to parents via Parents Gateway before the CCA begins in Term
1 Week 3. Students involved in CCA competitions may have more training
sessions to better prepare them.</p>
<p>If your child is not involved in after-school programmes such as ACE,
SDR, RRP and E2K before his/her CCA, we strongly encourage him/her to return
home for lunch before reporting back to school for his/her CCA, please
remind your child to report to the canteen if he/she reaches school before
2.45pm. We seek your understanding on this matter.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>CCA Guidelines</h4>
<p>Each student will only be allocated 1 CCA. Participation in additional
CCA may only be allowed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Students must remain in their CCA for the whole year. They may only change
to a new CCA at the beginning of each year, which is subject to availability
and on a case-by-case basis. All requests must be made through email to
the point of contact, Mr Leonard Toh (toh_jia_bin_leonard@moe.edu.sg) only
at the end of the year (Term 4, 1st Oct to 10th Oct). The school encourages
all students to remain in the CCA in order to deepen their skills, knowledge
and friendships in the CCA.</p>
<p>Students who may be involved in future inter-school competitions may be
asked to attend additional training sessions in the afternoons and/or during
school holidays.</p>
<p>Students must meet at least 85% attendance criteria before their CCA participation
can be recorded in their Student Holistic Report Card.</p>
<p>Participation in external activities for the purpose of self-enrichment
or social interaction as well as those that are already offered in school
will not be considered as a CCA.</p>
<p>No student should be loitering outside the school between school dismissal
time and the start of CCA. Instead, they should make the best use of the
time to complete their homework or self-study.</p>
<p>P6 students will only have CCA in Semester 1.</p>
<p>Should there be a request for student to participate in the National School
Games (NSG), Competitions or Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and the sport/activity
is not part of the school’s CCA, interest to participate must be made through
email to Mr Leonard Toh (toh_jia_bin_leonard@moe.edu.sg) between January
to the end of February yearly and to include information on student’s level
of preparation for the competition.</p>

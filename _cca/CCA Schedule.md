<p><strong>CCA Schedule</strong>
</p>
<p>CCA will take place after school on either Monday, Tuesday or Thursday.
CCA will start from 2.45pm to 4.45pm. Dates and other relevant information
will be sent to parents via Parents Gateway before the CCA begins in Term

sessions to better prepare them.</p>
<p>If your child is not involved in after-school programmes such as ACE,
SDR, RRP and E2K before his/her CCA, we strongly encourage him/her to return
home for lunch before reporting back to school for his/her CCA, please
remind your child to report to the canteen if he/she reaches school before
2.45pm. We seek your understanding on this matter.</p>

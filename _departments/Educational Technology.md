<h4><strong>Teaching &amp; Learning</strong></h4>
<p>The ICT department supports the teaching and learning by providing:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the infrastructure that supports students’ learning with ICT tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>training to equip teachers to design and conduct ICT-facilitated lessons.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In line with MOE’s direction for its&nbsp;Master Plan 4, the school focuses
on developing its resources (both hardware and software) to support teachers
in facilitating their lessons with the aid of ICT tools. ICT in Curriculum
seeks to bring about a synergistic delivery of ICT in education outcomes.
Different types of ICT tools that are relevant to the lessons will be deployed
to support the learning process. As teachers plan for their lesson, they
take into consideration the affordances of different technological tools
available and consider carefully how these tools will help to achieve the
lesson objectives and plan for the type of interactions that happen during
the ICT-facilitated lessons. Teachers also have to take into consideration
the appropriateness and ease of use of these tools for the learners in
their classrooms. For example, in P2, during one of the Chinese lessons,
the teachers engage students in learning and reviewing some Chinese characters
and hanyu pinyin using Chinese Characters First Step mobile app. In another
English class in P5, teachers enhance students’ understanding of an English
text through an online tool, Kami. The school encourages the use of a variety
of tools that are relevant to the lesson planned. Teachers are supported
by ICT mentors in the crafting of ICT-facilitated lessons.</p>
<p>In order to move towards better engagement during these ICT-facilitated
lessons, P1 students will go through structured touch-typing programme
to equip them with the basic skill that will enable them to use ICT tools
more effectively as they progress to upper levels.</p>
<p>Besides being used to enhance the delivery of teaching content, ICT is
also used for assessment of learning, e.g. PSLE e-Oral for Mother Tongue
subjects &amp; PSLE e-broadcast for Listening Comprehension.</p>
<h4><strong>Cyber Wellness (CW)</strong></h4>
<p>Our Cyber Wellness (CW) programme is guided by MOE CW Framework. The framework
is designed to develop students’ instinct to protect and empower them to
take responsibility for their own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles
that guide the programme are:
<br>1. Respect for Self and Others
<br>2. Safe and Responsible Use
<br>3. Positive Peer Influence</p>
<p>Our school aims to guide our students to become significant citizens by
being responsible digital learners to demonstrate respect for self and
others and practise safe and positive use of technologies while they are
online. The programme also aims to train and equip students with the appropriate
strategies to manage cyber dangers and be a positive influence to their
peers.</p>
<p>Our CW outreach includes the following:</p>

<p>Form Teacher Guidance Period CW focussed lessons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just-in-time CW message inculcation</p>

<h4><strong>Student Learning Space (SLS)</strong></h4>
<p>As part of its commitment to nurturing future-ready learners, the Ministry
of Education (MOE) had announced that all students in Singapore schools
will be supported in their learning by the Singapore Student Learning Space
(SLS), an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources
and learning tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of
technology. Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere and at their
own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers will also
be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching, further
enriching students’ learning experience.</p>
<p>The school will be assigning structured Home-Based Learning (HBL) assignments
via the SLS portal. It will be set for students once termly. Teachers would
also be using the platform to set additional work or post additional resources
for the students that are relevant to what they are learning. Parents can
encourage their children to make use of the contents in the portal to do
revision on the topics they have learnt or self-learning for the topics
that they are going to learn.</p>
<p>Accessing the site regularly help the students familiarise themselves
with the navigation of the portal. In the event of emergency school closure,
the portal will be one of the points through which the school will deploy
its learning content to ensure continuity of lesson. A computer and internet
connection is required for pupils to access the SLS portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure that no child is disadvantaged and every child has access to
a computer &amp; broadband internet connection at home, the government
is providing subsidy to low-income households to acquire them at an affordable
price through the NEU PC Plus Programme. Please click on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/neupc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>&nbsp;to

<h3>English Language Department</h3>
<h4>Confident and Proficient Users of the English Language who enjoy learning</h4>
<p>The Springdale Learning Experience (SLE) is guided by our educational
philosophy of Play, Passion and Purpose. Our English Curriculum leverages
the 3Ps (Play.Passion.Purpose.) to design learning experiences that motivate
and meet students’ needs; and involve students as active participants.</p>
<p>At SDPS, we adopt the Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading
(STELLAR), a national pedagogic framework, in the learning of the English
Language. The STELLAR approach seeks to build strong fundamentals by weaving
the areas of language learning through a whole part whole approach where
students enjoy reading, viewing, writing and listening to different literature.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<p>In line with the fast changing educational landscape, our programmes gives
attention to multiliteracies, metacognitive skills and exploratory talk
in order to help our students achieve 21st century competencies across
all areas of language learning.</p>

<h5>Read &amp; Grow @SDPS</h5>
<p>We believe that our students have to be concerned citizens who are cognisant
of what is happening around them and in the world. Read &amp; Grow @SDPS
seeks to heighten our students awareness of current affairs through sharing
of news happenings and getting our students to take different perspectives
with the thinking routine – I see, feel, think and wonder.</p>

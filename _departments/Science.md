<h3>Science Department</h3>
<p>The Primary Science Syllabus aims to provide students with opportunities/experiences
to:</p>
<p>• build on their interest and stimulate their curiosity about themselves
and their environment.
<br>• acquire basic scientific concepts to help them understand themselves
and the world around them.
<br>• develop skills, dispositions, and attitudes for scientific inquiry.
<br>• apply scientific concepts and skills in making responsible decisions.
<br>• appreciate how science influences people and the environment.
<br>Guided by the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Science Curriculum Framework,
our science curriculum aims to equip our students with scientific literacy
and instill in them the sense of curiosity so that they may continue to
be inspired by science, inquire like scientists, and innovate using science.

<p><strong>Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Learning Alive! – Augmented Reality enhanced Inquiry-Based Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Augmented Reality (AR) has enormous potential in learning and is recognised
as an emergent technology in education. AR affords scaffolds for students
to experience and observe virtual phenomenon and processes as part of their
present environment. AR opens more possibilities to create problem scenario.</p>

<p>Source of figure: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-023-10235-y</p>
<p>The school adopts&nbsp;the use of a framework built on Questioning, Investigating,
Making and Synthesising (QIMS) to scaffold the learning process. Our AR
enhanced inquiry based learning packages allows our students to delve deeper
into the learning of Science.</p>

<p><strong>(2) T(h)inkering with S.T.E.M Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Adopting a fun, creative and hands-on approach to learning Science, our
STEM learning programme involves
<br>
</p>
<p>• in-curriculum performance tasks which provide tinkering challenges integrating
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S.T.E.M) learning in
our very own Makerspace.
<br>• Integrated Project Work with Cross-curricular integrations help students
better visualize and understand concepts in an enjoyable &amp; engaging
manner in real world contexts of problem solving.</p>

<p><strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Eco-stewardship @ SDPS</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Eco-stewardship activities aims to increase students’ awareness and
understanding of environmental issues and provide platforms for students
to play their part for the environment and express their ideas in advocating
eco-friendly practices. We hope to heighten the sense of responsibility
and care for Mother Earth in our students. Some green activities to encourage
this include recycling and upcycling activities, the Clean plate campaign
and the National Youth Upcycling Movement (NYUM). Environmental education
is also imbued in Values-In-Action programmes at various levels.</p>

<p><strong>(5)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Science X-perience Week</strong>
</p>
<p>Themed as ‘Igniting the Spirit of Innovation through STEM’, this exciting
week brings about showcasing of experiments and works by students. Some
activities include Science busking, toy design, show-and-tell competition,
and demonstration of STEM projects. From the science busker demonstrations,
outstanding teams are invited to participate in the Singapore Science Buskers
competition organised by the Science Centre Singapore.</p>

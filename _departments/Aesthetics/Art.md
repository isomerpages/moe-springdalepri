##### Art Framework&nbsp;&nbsp;  

The Learning Outcomes of the Art curriculum are organised by levels in 2-year blocks and according to the cognitive and artistic development of the students. The objectives of the syllabus are achieved through the framework of&nbsp;**See**,&nbsp;**Express**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Appreciate**. The three behavioural domains of seeing, expressing and appreciating take into consideration the cognitive, affective and psychomotor dimensions that students are involved in when learning art. This ensures that students are provided with opportunities to observe their environment, generate ideas, create artworks, discuss about art and value the role of art in society.



| See| Express | Appreciate |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| In&nbsp;_Seeing_&nbsp;art, our students observe their surroundings closely, analyse &amp; reflect on their visual &amp; other experiences. The focus will be on recording &amp; interpreting as means towards developing student’s observation &amp; visual inquiry. Students will be equipped with tools such as drawing to capture &amp; reflect on their observations &amp; experiences.     | In&nbsp;_Expressing_&nbsp;art, our students generate ideas from what they see &amp; explore ways to create &amp; communicate through the use of various conventional &amp; unconventional materials &amp; tools, art forms &amp; media. Students also experiment &amp; innovate with visual elements, quality of materials, tools &amp; artistic processes in order to meet an artistic intention.     | In&nbsp;_Appreciating_&nbsp;art, our students acquire skills &amp; use appropriate art vocabulary to discuss &amp; interpret artworks. Students deepen their understanding of Singapore through drawing inspirations from their environment, learning about artworks &amp; artists from local &amp; other culture &amp; context to make connections &amp; understand the values of art in their lives &amp; society.|

**Aims of Music Education**  
a. Acquire and apply musical skills, knowledge and understanding through Listening, Creating and Performing  
b. Develop abilities for creative expression and communication  
c. Develop an understanding and appreciation of music in local and global cultures  
d. Cultivate a life-long enjoyment and involvement in music.



**Scope of Learning**  
To fulfil the aims of Music Education, the syllabus spans across 3 key stages from Primary 1 to 6. Each stage comprises 2 levels which builds upon the competencies from the previous stage(s). The expected knowledge and skills that students should acquire over the 2 years of each stage are detailed in the Learning Outcomes (LOs). 

All the LOs will be addressed and learned in spiral progression, where elements and concepts are learned through active musical experiences, such as music creation and performance as well as movement in music. 

**Music Curriculum Concept**  
The Primary Music curriculum seeks to develop musical understanding through 3 Musical Processes of Listening, Creating and Performing.  As illustrated below, the 3 Musical Processes are core to the Music Curriculum Concept and inter-related and inter-dependent in practice.

The display of musical processes draws on studentsâ€™ learning and understanding of musical elements and concepts during their musical exploration.

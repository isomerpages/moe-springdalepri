<h3>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</h3>
<h4>DEPARTMENT PROGRAMMES</h4>
<p><strong>Character &amp; Citizenship Education</strong>
<br>In Springdale Primary School, we are committed to nurture students of
good character so that they can develop to be secure individuals, leaders
of self-worth and significant citizens of tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Department Programmes</strong>
<br>The school’s Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) department have
put in place the following programmes &amp; initiatives:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Behaviour Management</strong>
<br>With the establishment of school rules &amp; routines, the teachers play
an important role in enforcing positive behaviour in the students. In Springdale
Primary, we uphold the philosophy of ‘Discipline with dignity, management
with care’. When correcting students’ behaviour, it is important to reinforce
school values and help students see how they can put values into actions.
It is also of utmost importance that teachers restore students’ self-confidence
in the process of correcting students’ behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social-Emotional Management</strong>
<br>The school provides care for students with social-emotional &amp;/or special
learning needs through individualised sessions conducted by our in-house
Allied Educators for counselling and for learning and behavioural support
respectively. They spend one-to-one session with these students to equip
them with coping skills to overcome their challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student Leadership</strong>
<br>Our Student Leadership development incorporates the cultivation of values
and dispositions and this includes the following:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>self-awareness and understanding of others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>having a set of sound values and perspective-taking skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>good organization skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ability to embrace and manage change</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The school’s approach to student leadership training is to expose students
to lead self, empower them to lead their peers, engage them to lead school
and they excel to become leaders of leaders. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The school will expose all students to pursue self-mastery on this journey
towards self-leadership. Leadership traits will be teased out from CCE
&amp; FTGP lessons as well as the Values Education talks during Assembly
to help students learn the art of leading self before they can lead others.</p>
<p>The school will also empower student leaders to perform their roles with
needed guidance from the Teachers. Leadership training will be conducted
for selected Primary 3 Prefects during the leadership camp in March.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</strong>
<br>The FTGP is conducted by both Form and Co-Form Teachers with MOE resources
to equip students with social-emotional competencies to help them appreciate
different perspectives, value the feelings of others and learn to better
relate to their peers. Parental involvement is encouraged through parents’
participation in the Family Time Activities that are part of the syllabus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</strong>
<br>Social-emotional skills taught during Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)
are reinforced and demonstrated in the weekly PAL lessons for the Primary
1 and 2 students. These lessons are conducted by both Form and Co-Form
Teachers. The PAL programme consists of various modules, namely I Can Module,
Visual Arts, Performing Arts, Outdoors Education and Sports &amp; Games.</p>

<p><strong>Teacher-Student Chit-Chat sessions</strong>
<br>The school believes that good Teacher-Student Relationship is important
in cultivating good learning habits &amp; nurturing students to maximise
their potential. Knowing students beyond the classroom context is important
as it gives teachers a more holistic understanding of how he/she is at
home, his/her interaction with others &amp; his/her learning habits. Beyond
academic development, the school hopes having chit-chat session will also
be an opportunity for teachers to build positive bond with the students
to influence an all-round development of the child.</p>
<p><strong>Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) Lessons</strong>
<br>CCE lessons are conducted every week by Mother Tongue Teachers. Through
the CCE lessons, students learn about the values of Respect, Responsibility,
Resilience, Integrity, Care &amp; Harmony (R&nbsp;3&nbsp;ICH) and social-emotional
competencies and skills related to citizenship competencies. Parental involvement
is encouraged through parents’ participation in the Family Time Activities
that are part of the syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Assembly &amp; Assembly Talks on School Values</strong>
<br>Every term, the department conducts Assembly Talks on the values of the
term so as to help students develop a deeper understanding of the school
values and how they can apply them in daily life:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Term 1: Respect &amp; Responsibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Term 2: Care &amp; Harmony</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Term 3: Integrity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Term 4: Resilience</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Values-In-Action (VIA) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the school’s VIA programme, class duties are carried out on
a daily basis to develop in students a sense of responsibility. Besides
daily class duties, the school provides once-a-term protected time during
CCE lesson for CCE teachers to carry out VIA activities. Every term’s VIA
activities allows students to apply the values they have learnt throughout
the term. After each VIA activity, students reflect on the values they
have put into practise, as well as how they can continue to apply the values
in their daily lives. Students are also encouraged to practise at home
what they have learnt in school. The school seeks parents’ involvement
and support in this area to ensure application of learning both in school
and at home.</p>

in students a sense of belonging, commitment &amp; rootedness to Singapore.

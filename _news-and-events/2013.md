Despite being the youngest of the 22 participants under his category, he has come in a commendable 7th position in the National Bilingual Storytelling Competition 2013 (Lower Primary Category), jointly organised by National Library Board and Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism.  
  
This competition, held on Sat, 27 Jul 13, aims to create opportunities for children to develop their presentation skills in English and their Mother Tongue Language. It is an inter-primary school competition opened to all pupils from Primary 1 to 6. With this experience under his belt, we are confident that Yi Heng will perform even better whilst encouraging more pupils to participate in the other competitions in the coming future.

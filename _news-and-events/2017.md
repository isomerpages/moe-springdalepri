#### Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2017 Art Exhibition

The Singapore Youth Festival 2017 Art Exhibition celebrated the artist in every child. It showcased children’s creative ideas, personal aspirations and hard work put into artistic expressions. This year’s exhibition was a tribute to the deep learning and rich experience our students gain through the art curriculum in schools. 

  

The theme for this year “Artist and Space” invites our student artists to imagine, inquire and discover many ways to interpret and express the concept of ‘space’. In the process, they found inspiration from people, places and objects within their environment and created artworks that were personal and meaningful to them.

  

This year, our school submitted 2 artworks for Category B and Category C respectively for the Art Exhibition. The submission for Category C has been awarded with 

Certificate of Recognition and was exhibited during the Singapore Youth Festival 2017 Art Exhibition.

  

All the artworks can be viewed via the Online Gallery within the SYF Website:

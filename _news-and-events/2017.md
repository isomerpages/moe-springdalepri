#### Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2017 Art Exhibition

The Singapore Youth Festival 2017 Art Exhibition celebrated the artist in every child. It showcased children’s creative ideas, personal aspirations and hard work put into artistic expressions. This year’s exhibition was a tribute to the deep learning and rich experience our students gain through the art curriculum in schools. 

  

The theme for this year “Artist and Space” invites our student artists to imagine, inquire and discover many ways to interpret and express the concept of ‘space’. In the process, they found inspiration from people, places and objects within their environment and created artworks that were personal and meaningful to them.

  

This year, our school submitted 2 artworks for Category B and Category C respectively for the Art Exhibition. The submission for Category C has been awarded with 

Certificate of Recognition and was exhibited during the Singapore Youth Festival 2017 Art Exhibition.

  

All the artworks can be viewed via the Online Gallery within the SYF Website:

|Artists' Statement|The little dot on the Singapore map, which is the physical space that we live in, represents us - the future. We form both the ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ spaces in Singapore. These spaces are important because they influence and mould us. We are greatly affected by everything that happens.
|Guiding Teacher|Mdm Siti Ashlinda
|Teacher's Statement|Students’ artwork is a minimalistic ideology of them being a part of their physical space – Singapore. Through discussions and explorations, students unpacked the definition of ‘Space’ and decided to narrow down to the positive and negative spaces as they loved the simple yet concrete characteristics of the elements.

|Artists' Statement|Through an abstract headphone, we experience audio space in this vast world. Audio is made out of frequency and pitch that fills up our physical space. The doodles represent different sounds that we hear. Despite the unlimited doodles, we do have boundaries and ‘roadblocks’ that prevent us from hearing everything.
|Guiding Teacher|	Mdm Siti Ashlinda 
|Teacher's Statement|Students’ artwork depicts their exploration of the ideology of virtual and real spaces. The canvases are the intended real space while the doodle depiction of sound is the virtual space. The canvases are intended to have a five-centimetre gap to show the boundaries that preclude them.

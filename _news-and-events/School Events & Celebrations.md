##### Hari Raya Puasa 2023
Our school celebrated Hari Raya Puasa on 28 April 2023. During the assembly programme, our P4 Malay language students presented a dikir barat item comprising of a medley of popular songs such as “Di Pinggiran Aidilfitri” and “Wau Bulan”. The heartwarming performance captured the hearts of the audience.

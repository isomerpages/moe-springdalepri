<h3>School Holistic Assessment</h3>
<p>Assessment is an important part of learning and teaching, it provides
useful information to the students, teachers and parents. Assessment is
carried out for two main purposes: to measure students' attainment and
provide evidence of learning, and to support and improve classroom teaching
and student learning.</p>
<p>The key focus of assessment is on building students' confidence and motivation
to learn. Thus, assessment will focus on providing rich information on
the learning progress of the students. Quantitative feedback in the form
of grades and marks, along with qualitative feedback in the form of teacher
comments will help students learn about their strengths, areas for improvement
and the steps they can take to improve in their learning. This feedback
can also help parents better support their child's learning and development.</p>
<p>The school uses various assessment modes to support the development of
the whole child. Single-point assessments such as semestral examinations
have been de-emphasised. Instead, bite-sized forms of assessment, such
as mini-tests and performance tasks, will be used to provide students with
more opportunities to experience success and build their confidence and
desire to learn. Teachers will also use a range of assessment strategies
such as questioning to support students' learning.</p>
<p>Parents will receive information about their child's progress through
regular communication with the teachers.</p>
<p>Holistic Assessment aims to provide information on students' mastery and
attainment, as well as information to improve learning and teaching, and
ensure the balanced and appropriate use of different assessment modes,
in order to better support students' holistic development.</p>

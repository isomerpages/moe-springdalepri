<p><strong>Assessment in Primary 1 and Primary 2</strong>
</p>
<p>Assessment is an important part of learning and teaching and helps provide
useful information to the pupils, teachers and parents. Assessment is carried
out for two main purposes; to measure pupils’ attainment and report evidence
of learning and also to support and improve classroom teaching and pupil
learning.</p>
<p>At Primary 1 and 2, the key focus will be on building the pupils’ confidence
and desire to learn. Thus, assessment will focus on providing rich information
on the learning progress of the pupils. Quantitative feedback in the form
of grades and marks, and qualitative feedback in the form of teacher comments
and rubrics will help pupils learn about their strengths, weaknesses and
the steps they can take to improve in their learning. This feedback can
also help parents better support their child’s learning and development.</p>
<p>Under Holistic Assessment, the school will explore the use of appropriate
assessments for different purposes to support the development of the whole
child. At Primary 1 and 2, single-point assessments such as semestral examinations
will be de-emphasised to ensure a smoother transition from pre-school to
primary school. Bite-sized forms of assessment, such as topical tests and
performance tasks, will be used to provide pupils with more opportunities
to experience success and build their confidence and desire to learn. Teachers
will also use a range of assessment strategies such as questioning and
conferencing to support pupils’ learning.</p>
<p>Parents will receive information about their child’s progress through
termly progress cards as well as mid-year and end-year report cards. Parents
will also receive information through a portfolio containing artifacts
of their child’s work.</p>
<p>In summary, Holistic Assessment aims to provide information on pupils’
mastery and attainment, as well as information to improve learning and
teaching, and ensure the balanced and appropriate use of different assessment
methods, in order to better support pupils’ holistic development.&nbsp;</p>

The Multi-Sport CCA offers various sport modules which are planned and facilitated by our teachers. The list of sports may include Ultimate Frisbee, floorball, football, touch rugby, netball pickleball, badminton, kickball and other modified games.&nbsp; Students will be able to learn and apply skills to actual and modified versions of the games on a weekly basis. Our aim is for the students to be exposed to new sports and games and be comfortable in learning and finding out more of their strengths through play.

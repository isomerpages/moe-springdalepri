The Outdoor Adventure CCA hopes to instill in students a love for the outdoors through the outdoor adventure activities. The activities also seek to develop character values such as confidence, courage, responsibility and resilience.  
  

Through the natural and social environments offered by the outdoor adventure activities, students will be able to make connections with their self, others and the environment. Students will also be exposed to adventure activities in meaningful ways to develop their interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. Some of the adventure activities include problem solving, outdoor cooking, orienteering, campcraft, knotting & pioneering, challenge ropes course, water sports, camps and journey/expeditions. The CCA hopes to provide students with new skills, adventure, lasting memories and inculcate in them positive values and healthy lifestyles.

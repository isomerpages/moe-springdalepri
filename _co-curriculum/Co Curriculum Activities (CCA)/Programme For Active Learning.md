Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an initiative of MOE. During PAL, P1 and P2 students are given exposure and experiences&nbsp;through fun and&nbsp;varied activities that facilitate their&nbsp;holistic development&nbsp;in the physical,&nbsp;cognitive, social, aesthetics and moral domains. The main focus of PAL is to provide varied avenues for students to develop&nbsp;social-emotional competencies. 4 periods are set aside each week for PAL lessons.  
  
PAL@Springdale is experiential in nature and incorporates learning in a creative, fun and enjoyable way. The packages for the various modules are customised according to the needs and profile of our students. Applying the learner-centred approach to impart social-emotional skills within the context of the four domains, these school-based curriculum provides a wide range of learning experiences for students through a variety of pedagogical strategies such as cooperative learning, inquiry-based learning and reflective learning. Opportunities are created for students to apply the attitudes, skills and knowledge acquired during the lessons and learning journeys.  
  
The following are the programme that the Primary 1 and Primary 2 students go through during PAL lessons

The school focuses on specific Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies at different levels, with a focus on Self-Awareness and Self-Management in Primary 1 and Self-Management, Social Awareness and Relationship Management in Primary 2.Through these programmes, besides building their character and social skills, we hope students will also discover their interests and develop their talents.

### Primary 1 Programmes

##### TERM 1 - I CAN! PART 1

The domain on&nbsp;**I Can!**&nbsp;Programme is designed to develop students’ competence in self-management, social interaction and independence in navigating beyond their classrooms. It consists of 3 modules and each module spans over 3 lessons. I Can is divided into 2 modules.

Module 1 is part of a transition programme for the Primary 1 students. In this module, the students will learn to navigate their new school environment, how to take care of themselves, their friends as well as their environment in a primary school setting.

Module 2 on Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT) seeks to develop students’ competence in handling technology devices such as a laptop. In this module, they also learn the basic typing skills to enable them to be prepared for ICT-based lessons.

  

##### TERM 2 - OUTDOOR EDUCATION

**Outdoor Education**&nbsp;&nbsp;provides a platform for students to experience the outdoors and equip them with the necessary intrapersonal and interpersonal skills as they go about working in their teams. Students will learn about acceptable behaviours and safety at public places, packing right for activities, gardening, etc. They will also be given opportunities to use explore their surroundings using the different senses. Being able to observe animals and plants in their natural settings also allows them to experience life beyond textbooks and appreciate nature for what it is. Through constant exposure to the outdoors, students become more confident to work in natural settings.

##### TERM 3 - VISUAL ARTS

Visual Arts domain focuses on students exploring with various art medium to express themselves creatively. Primary 1 students learn to express their feelings and emotions using colours. They learn how different colours are associated with different moods and emotions. From this, students are led to understand how they can manage their emotions and feelings better, reinforcing the SE competency of self-awareness. The lesson on Body Talk serves to inform students that different body postures convey different moods. Students are led to understand how certain behaviour and postures denote their emotions and how they respond to certain situations, leading them to discover how they can better handle themselves positively.

##### TERM 4 - PERFORMING ARTS: DRAMA

In Performing Arts: Drama domain, role-play is used as a strategy to allow students to safely explore options of behaviour and the consequences in the fictional world. The collaborative learning environment builds the students’ self- and social-awareness as they learn how to manage their emotions and reactions in social settings. Students also practice responsible decision-making when they have to discuss the choices the fictional characters have to make.

### Primary 2 Programmes

##### TERM 1 - SPORTS and GAMES

Sports &amp; Games provides opportunities for students to learn more about working with one another through games. One interesting game is Mosquitoes, Bears and Salmon, an activity similar to our Singaporean favourite, Scissors, Paper and Stone. Students are required to come up with strategies to win as a team. They also have opportunities to develop interpersonal skills such as turn-taking and listening to others in order to build positive relationships. In addition, students also learn to look out for their own and others’ safety while following instructions to perform the tasks effectively.  
  

##### TERM 2 - YOUNG T(H)INKERS and ICT  


The P2 Young T(h)inkers Programme aims to develop in students the flexible &amp; generative mindsets for creative problem-solving. This programme is anchored on the school’s belief that every student can be an effective problem solver and is part of the School’s ALP Programme in nurturing empathetic change makers. This programme allows students to apply the use of Springdale’s ABC Innovation protocol which was taught through Springdale’s ALP Signature Programme:  

*   **A**ssess the problem
*   **B**rainstorm for solutions
*   **C**heck viability of solutions or&nbsp;**C**reate a prototype&nbsp;

Building on&nbsp;_(1)&nbsp;**constructivism**_&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;_(2)&nbsp;**constructionism**_, the school believes that students learn best when they construct their understanding through exploring ideas, making things &amp; collaborating with others. Together with the skills learnt in the ABC Innovation Protocol, every student can solve real-life problems around them through problem identification, ideation &amp; iteration.

  

The Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT) module seeks to deepen students’ competence in handling technology devices such as a laptop or a tablet device. In this module, students will revisit some basic typing skills and explore the use of Moo-O application to enhance their oracy skill in a fun manner.

_(1)&nbsp;**Constructivism**_&nbsp;– A learning theory that believes that people are active meaning seekers and construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world though experiences and reflecting on those experiences.

_(2)_&nbsp;_Constructionism_&nbsp;– A learning theory that believes people construct mental models to understand the world around them. Also believes that learning can happen most effectively when people are active in making tangible objects in the real world. Constructionism is closely associated with experiential learning and builds on ideas of constructivism

##### TERM 3 - PERFORMING ARTS: MUSIC

In Performing Arts: Music, students conduct exploration of musical elements and concepts such as metre, dynamics and tempo, with certain focused SEL skills and competencies in mind. Students acquire the musical concepts through listening, singing, dancing, performing and most importantly, music-making. Through these activities, students will be able to enhance their musicianship through music composition, percussive &amp; instrumental playing experiences and group discussion and collaboration. At the same time, the knowledge and skills acquired and developed are underpinned by values that will shape and define the students’ characters, attitudes and beliefs.  

##### TERM 4 - PERFORMING ARTS: DANCE&nbsp;

Varied dance activities set a context for structured learning experiences for socio-emotional learning (SEL) to take place. Fun and enjoyable activities are planned to provide experiences that will engage students physically, cognitively and emotionally. To ensure that students are kept engaged throughout the lesson, multiple age-appropriate activities move swiftly from one episode to the next. Through creating, performing and appreciating movements, students express themselves in a safe environment with the teacher.

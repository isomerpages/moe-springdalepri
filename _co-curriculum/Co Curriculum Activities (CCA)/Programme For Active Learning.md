Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an initiative of MOE. During PAL, P1 and P2 students are given exposure and experiences&nbsp;through fun and&nbsp;varied activities that facilitate their&nbsp;holistic development&nbsp;in the physical,&nbsp;cognitive, social, aesthetics and moral domains. The main focus of PAL is to provide varied avenues for students to develop&nbsp;social-emotional competencies. 4 periods are set aside each week for PAL lessons.  
  
PAL@Springdale is experiential in nature and incorporates learning in a creative, fun and enjoyable way. The packages for the various modules are customised according to the needs and profile of our students. Applying the learner-centred approach to impart social-emotional skills within the context of the four domains, these school-based curriculum provides a wide range of learning experiences for students through a variety of pedagogical strategies such as cooperative learning, inquiry-based learning and reflective learning. Opportunities are created for students to apply the attitudes, skills and knowledge acquired during the lessons and learning journeys.  
  
The following are the programme that the Primary 1 and Primary 2 students go through during PAL lessons

They learn how different colours are associated with different moods and emotions. From this, students are led to understand how they can manage their emotions and feelings better, reinforcing the SE competency of self-awareness. The lesson on Body Talk serves to inform students that different body postures convey different moods. Students are led to understand how certain behaviour and postures denote their emotions and how they respond to certain situations, leading them to discover how they can better handle themselves positively.

In Performing Arts: Drama domain, role-play is used as a strategy to allow students to safely explore options of behaviour and the consequences in the fictional world. The collaborative learning environment builds the students’ self- and social-awareness as they learn how to manage their emotions and reactions in social settings. Students also practice responsible decision-making when they have to discuss the choices the fictional characters have to make.

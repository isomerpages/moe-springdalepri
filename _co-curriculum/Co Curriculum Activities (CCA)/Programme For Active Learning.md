Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an initiative of MOE. During PAL, P1 and P2 students are given exposure and experiences through fun and varied activities that facilitate their holistic development in the physical, cognitive, social, aesthetics and moral domains. The main focus of PAL is to provide varied avenues for students to develop social-emotional competencies. 4 periods are set aside each week for PAL lessons.  
  
PAL@Springdale is experiential in nature and incorporates learning in a creative, fun and enjoyable way. The packages for the various modules are customised according to the needs and profile of our students. Applying the learner-centred approach to impart social-emotional skills within the context of the four domains, these school-based curriculum provides a wide range of learning experiences for students through a variety of pedagogical strategies such as cooperative learning, inquiry-based learning and reflective learning. Opportunities are created for students to apply the attitudes, skills and knowledge acquired during the lessons and learning journeys.  
  
The following are the programme that the Primary 1 and Primary 2 students go through during PAL lessons

The school focuses on specific Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies at different levels, with a focus on Self-Awareness and Self-Management in Primary 1 and Self-Management, Social Awareness and Relationship Management in Primary 2.Through these programmes, besides building their character and social skills, we hope students will also discover their interests and develop their talents.

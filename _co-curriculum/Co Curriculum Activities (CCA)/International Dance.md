The International Dance CCA aims to empower students to communicate and express their feelings through creative movements and ideas. In the midst of exploring different dance genres, they will also learn to appreciate different cultural perspectives. Opportunities will be given to students to display their artistic flair. Through such team work and choreography, students' confidence and poise will be developed.

The&nbsp;Inno-T(h)inkers&nbsp;Club&nbsp;CCA aims to imbue in students the flexible and generative mindsets and skill sets for creative problem-solving through A-B-C process that is based on the&nbsp; Design Thinking (DT) protocol and computer programming. DT is about having the creative confidence that everyone can be part of creating a more desirable future and a process to take action when faced with a difficult challenge. Programming is the art of telling a computer what to do through a set of instructions and these instructions are written in a computerâ€™s language or code. Students would be working in collaborative groups and, using both the DT protocol and coding, work on real-world problems and issues.

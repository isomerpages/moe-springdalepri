The Ukulele CCA aims to nurture students with passion for the performing arts through an instrumental ensemble. Students will learn the basic techniques of ukulele-playing and develop sight-reading and ensemble skills when they perform accompaniment and ensemble pieces. There will be multiple platforms to hone and showcase the studentsâ€™ ukulele-playing skills so as to build their confidence, resilience and team spirit.

The Basketball CCA provides opportunities for students to learn and apply the fundamental basketball skills such as passing, dribbling, shooting and lay-up. Students will be taught concepts such as moving into space, attacking and defending. They will also learn the rules and progressively apply them in the game of basketball. Training would include basic ball skills, stamina building, agility and coordination exercises under the close supervision of the teachers and coach. The students will also learn values such as sportsmanship, fairplay, teamwork and discipline.

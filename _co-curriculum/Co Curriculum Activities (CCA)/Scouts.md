The Scouts CCA is open to both boys and girls and hopes to provide an environment which is intellectually stimulating, physically active and directed towards satisfying the childâ€™s basic need to face and overcome various challenges.

  

Students will develop a strong sense of camaraderie as they work together in teams. They will be exposed to varied activities which would allow them to step out of their comfort zone to develop their character. Through these activities, students will become more confident and civic-conscious citizens. Some of the activities include going on field trips to learn more about other occupations, campcraft and survival skills. Students will also learn skills that would develop their creativity and enhance their problem-solving skills.

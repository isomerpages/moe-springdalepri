The Badminton CCA aims to nurture students' interest and passion for the game of badminton as they learn the basic skills and rules of the sport. Students will be taught the basic techniques of the sport, game concepts and strategies and will apply them in actual gameplay settings.&nbsp;In the course of the CCA, students will learn the values of sportsmanship, respect, excellence and teamwork. Students will also be given opportunities to represent schools in the National School Games if they excel in the sports.

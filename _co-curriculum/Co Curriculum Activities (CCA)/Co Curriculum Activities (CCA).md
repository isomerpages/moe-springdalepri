As part of the school’s Co-Curriculum Programmes (CCP) to support the holistic development of students, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are designed to develop students’ Attitudes, Skills and Knowledge (ASK) in the cognitive, physical and aesthetics domains. CCA will also provide a common space for friendships and social integration which develop students’ sense of identity and belonging to the school.  
  
The objectives of CCA are to:   
1.    Provide students with a platform to discover their interests and talents.  
2.    Develop specific ASK in students pertaining to the CCA.  
3.    Develop character and social-emotional competencies as students interact with one another.  
  

P4 and P5 students will be resuming CCA in Sem 2. Please note that P6 students will not be involved in CCA in Sem 2 (except for selected students in the school team) and the P3 students will be coming on board.

 **The CCA offered are based on a number of considerations:**  
 1.  Breadth of learning experiences of each student.   
 2.  Available facilities and resources  
 3.  Providing varied domains of CCA to cater to various interests  
 4.  Staff strength and manpower resources  
  
**Important points to note   
  
CCAs will be conducted after school on either Mondays, Tuesdays or Thursdays  
**  

The timing for CCAs on Monday is 3.00 pm – 4.30 pm. 

 CCAs on Tuesday and Thursday are carried out from 2.35 pm – 4.05 pm.

 If your child is not involved in after-school programmes such as ACE, SDR, RRP and E2K before his/her CCA, we **strongly encourage him/her to return home for lunch** before reporting back to school for his/her CCA. 

Please note that the lunch slot for your child, if he/she is not attending the above after-school programmes before his/her CCA, will be pushed later if he/she stays in school for his/her lunch. We seek your understanding on the matter. 

Students involved in CCA competitions may have more training sessions to better prepare them. Do also note that students **will not engage in strenuous activities for 2 weeks** after receiving their vaccination. 

No student should be loitering outside or around the school before the start of CCA. Disciplinary action will be taken if students are found to have committed offences outside of school in accordance to the school’s discipline policy and guidelines, including suspension from CCA.

##### CCA Guidelines

1. Each student will only be allocated 1 CCA. Participation in additional CCA may only be allowed on a case-by-case basis.

2. Students must remain in their CCA for the whole year. They may only change to a new CCA at the beginning of each year, which is subject to availability and on a case-by-case basis. All requests must be made through email to HOD PE only at the end of the year (**Term 4 Week 5**). The school encourages all students to remain in the CCA in order to deepen their skills, knowledge and friendships in the CCA.

3. Students who may be involved in future inter-school competitions may be asked to attend additional training sessions.

4. Students must meet at least 85% attendance criteria before their CCA participation can be recorded in their Student Holistic Report Card.

5. Participation in external activities for the purpose of self-enrichment or social interaction as well as those that are already offered in school will not be considered as a CCA.

6. Student should NOT be loitering around or outside the school before the start of CCAs. Instead, they should make the best use of the time to complete their homework or self-study.

7. P6 students will only have CCA in Semester 1.

8. Should there be a request for student to participate in the National School Games (NSG), Competitions or Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and the sport/activity is not part of the school’s CCA e.g. Wushu or Taekwondo, interest to participate must be made through email to HOD PE **by the end of 2022** and to include information on student’s level of preparation for the competition.

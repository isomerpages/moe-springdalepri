As part of the school’s Co-Curriculum Programmes (CCP) to support the holistic development of students, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are designed to develop students’ Attitudes, Skills and Knowledge (ASK) in the cognitive, physical and aesthetics domains. CCA will also provide a common space for friendships and social integration which develop students’ sense of identity and belonging to the school.  
  
The objectives of CCA are to:   
1.    Provide students with a platform to discover their interests and talents.  
2.    Develop specific ASK in students pertaining to the CCA.  
3.    Develop character and social-emotional competencies as students interact with one another.  
  

P4 and P5 students will be resuming CCA in Sem 2. Please note that P6 students will not be involved in CCA in Sem 2 (except for selected students in the school team) and the P3 students will be coming on board.

 **The CCA offered are based on a number of considerations:**  
 1.  Breadth of learning experiences of each student.   
 2.  Available facilities and resources  
 3.  Providing varied domains of CCA to cater to various interests  
 4.  Staff strength and manpower resources  
  
**Important points to note   
  
CCAs will be conducted after school on either Mondays, Tuesdays or Thursdays  
**  

The timing for CCAs on Monday is 3.00 pm – 4.30 pm. 

 CCAs on Tuesday and Thursday are carried out from 2.35 pm – 4.05 pm.

 If your child is not involved in after-school programmes such as ACE, SDR, RRP and E2K before his/her CCA, we **strongly encourage him/her to return home for lunch** before reporting back to school for his/her CCA. 

Please note that the lunch slot for your child, if he/she is not attending the above after-school programmes before his/her CCA, will be pushed later if he/she stays in school for his/her lunch. We seek your understanding on the matter. 

Students involved in CCA competitions may have more training sessions to better prepare them. Do also note that students **will not engage in strenuous activities for 2 weeks** after receiving their vaccination. 

No student should be loitering outside or around the school before the start of CCA. Disciplinary action will be taken if students are found to have committed offences outside of school in accordance to the school’s discipline policy and guidelines, including suspension from CCA.

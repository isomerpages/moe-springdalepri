The Choir CCA aims to equip students with the fundamentals of proper vocal techniques through songs of different genres and cultures. Students will learn to develop listening, sight-reading and performing skills when they sing as an ensemble. Singing helps students to express their emotions and creativity in a non-threatening environment. There will be opportunities for students to develop their confidence, learn to collaborate and perform at various platforms.Â 

  

Please note that auditions will be conducted to better match students to the CCA.

The Media Club aims to expose students to different types of media tools that aid presentation and communication. During the course of the CCA, students will learn about digital presentation and communication tools, go through relevant Cyber Wellness skills that are relevant to the tools learnt and also be involved in the use of media equipment. Students will have the opportunities to practise what they have learnt through hands-on sessions during school events and activities and also in curating digital artefacts for the school.

The school crest embodies a dignified eagle shaped like the letter ‘S’ to represent Springdale Primary School (康 德 小 学). Through opportunities and challenges, it remains steadfast and true to its purpose. This signifies Springdalites soaring high with a relentless drive.  
  
The wavy blue strokes are likened to a river gushing forth in spring, the season where a new lease of life begins. As the river meanders, it brings renewal and growth to the surrounding area. This exemplifies the potentials of Springdalites as they journey through the various terrains in life, carving out valleys and canyons, leaving their mark wherever they tread.  
  
The three-leaf shamrock represents the shared responsibility of the Home-School-Community collaboration in nurturing the whole child.

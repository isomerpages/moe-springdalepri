Springdale the love you sow  
Moulding our lives  
Helping us grow  
  
Springdale we love you so  
Lighting our lives  
Together we’ll glow  
  
\* Yearning for truth  
Knowing our way  
Finding our purpose in life  
  
\* Springdale your love we’ll share  
Spreading the joy  
Everywhere  
  
(\*repeat)  
  
Springdalites, shining bright  
Springdalites, take flight

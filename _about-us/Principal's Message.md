<br>Dear Springdale Community,</p>
<p>It is both a joy and a privilege to introduce myself as the new Principal
of Springdale Primary School. I am excited to embark on this journey with
you, and I look forward to working closely with all students, staff, and
families to continue building on the strong foundation of this vibrant
school.</p>
<p>A little about myself: My journey in education began in an all-boys mission
secondary school, Montfort Secondary, where I was fortunate to learn and
grow alongside wonderful colleagues and students. The experiences I had
there shaped my passion for teaching and leadership, and I was honored
to serve as Vice Principal before pursuing my Master’s in Education, with
a focus on curriculum design. My career then led me to CHIJ Our Lady of
Good Counsel, an all-girls mission primary school, where I served as Vice
Principal for two years. These experiences were invaluable in deepening
my understanding of school leadership and the importance of creating environments
that foster both academic excellence and personal growth.</p>
<p>Following this, I had the privilege of leading Xishan Primary School as
Principal, where I was able to further hone my skills in nurturing a positive
school culture and empowering students and staff. Each of these roles has
equipped me with the experience and perspective necessary to lead with
purpose and compassion.</p>
<p>Now, as I step into my role at Springdale Primary, I look forward to serving
this school community with the same dedication and enthusiasm that I have
carried throughout my career. Springdale is truly a place of growth, where
learning is infused with joy and the spirit of exploration. The school’s
vibrant name reflects the zest for life and growth that we strive to cultivate
in our students. We believe in learning through play, offering endless
possibilities for our students to explore, discover, and be inspired, both
academically and personally.</p>
<p>At Springdale, we are committed to developing students who are not only
academically proficient but also well-rounded individuals. Through exposure
to contemporary issues, we encourage our students to grow as critical and
inventive thinkers, empowered to propose adaptive solutions and lead with
purpose. We focus on building resilience and confidence, equipping our
students with the tools they need to overcome challenges and excel in the
face of adversity.</p>
<p>The core values of our school—respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity,
care, and harmony—are fundamental in shaping the life skills of our students.
These values guide the way our students relate to others, fostering a community
of kindness, collaboration, and mutual respect. We believe in nurturing
students who are not only academically successful but also kind, empathetic,
and ready to make a positive impact on the world around them. I am excited
to join the Springdale family and to work alongside a dedicated team of
educators, staff, and parents in this shared mission. Together, I am confident
that we will continue to grow, learn, and inspire one another in the years
to come.</p>
<p>Thank you for the warm welcome, and I look forward to an exciting journey
with all of you!</p>
<p>Warm regards,
<br>Anne Quek
<br>Principal, Springdale Primary School</p>

**Rationale**

Homework is typically defined as any tasks “assigned to students by school teachers that are meant to be carried out during non-school hours \[1\]”.This, however, does not include time spent on revision of school work or studying for tests and examinations.  
  
Homework plays an important role in the holistic development of a child. For a new skill or knowledge to have long-lasting effects, distributed and sustained practice is necessary. Furthermore, homework assignments have a positive impact on the personal development of the students. It helps to develop good study habits and foster independent learning. It also has the prospects to foster partnership between parents and school in the child’s learning, hence reaffirming the important role of parents in education.  
  

**Guiding Principles**

As a general rule of thumb, the types and purposes of homework designed and disseminated are as follow, encapsulated in the acronym PEP:

| Type | Purpose | Examples of Homework |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Preparation     | Provide opportunities for students to gain background information on a unit of study so as to be better prepared for the coming lessons.     | - Background reading<br>-   Research-based work     |
|Extension|Provide opportunities for students to pursue knowledge collaboratively and independently so as to build on their prior knowledge and allow for the application of higher-order thinking.|-  Project-based work<br>-   Creative writing<br>-  Non-routine tasks
|Practice|Provide opportunities for students to reinforce learning or consolidate newly acquired skills or knowledge so as to facilitate the retention of facts and understanding of concepts.|-   Workbook exercises, revision exercises<br>-   STELLAR packages, problem sums packages<br>-   Learning of spelling, multiplication tables, etc.

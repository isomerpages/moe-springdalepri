Springdale Primary School commenced its operation in January 2013 and celebrated its 10th year of founding in 2022. The theme of the celebration, ‘Sprindalites Take Flight,’ articulated the school’s collective wish and aspiration to scale greater heights and guide the students to realize their aspirations, anchored on strong values and character. Through a holistic curriculum, the school hopes to nurture students who can thrive in complex environments beyond school.

We remain steadfast in our mission to engage young minds, mould their character, and equip them for the future. It is our commitment to develop every Springdalite to be all-rounded. We strive to inculcate good social and behavioural habits through interesting activities. We aim to develop our students to have a positive attitude towards learning, be self-directed and intrinsically motivated.

As every child is unique, we will support them to discover and develop their strengths and to manage their weaknesses. The school aims to provide all Springdalites an enriching Springdale Learning Experience to help them discover their talents and interests through our signature programmes - our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in critical and inventive problem-solving, our Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) in leadership development and our school-based character development programme.

Home-School Partnership is critical in the education of our students, and we need the support of parents for effective home-school partnership. Our students will succeed naturally when we work hand in hand to support them in their holistic development. Through our combined efforts, our students will develop the intrinsic motivation to learn and have a strong foundation grounded in values to achieve their aspirations. We also recognise the importance of establishing respectful boundaries to help our teachers do their jobs more effectively.

My staff and I look forward to collaborating with our parents as we strive to provide a conducive environment where learning is delightful, and children find joy in coming to school.

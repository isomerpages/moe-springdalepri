**Note on Reporting in the morning:**<br>
We would like to appeal to parents to send your child to school  only after 6.45 am  and to ensure he/she always have a book at hand to occupy him/her while waiting for class to start at 7.30 am as staff would only be present after 7.10am to supervise them. Having your child arrive in school by 7.15am would help your child to settle in better before the start of the lessons.

**Note on Dismissal in the afternoon:**<br>
We seek the cooperation from parents to only drive into the school compound to pick up their children from the school foyer _**after 1.45pm on**_ **Mon, Wed and Fri** and **after 1.20pm on Tue and Thu**.

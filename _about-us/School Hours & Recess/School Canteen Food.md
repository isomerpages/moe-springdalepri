The school plays an integral role in providing an environment that ensures the students pick up healthy eating habits from young since they are likely to consume at least one meal daily in the canteen. As such, the school has embarked on the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme (HMSP) in collaboration with Health Promotion Board (HPB) since 2013. Through this programme, the school hopes to provide healthier food and beverage choices to meet the students’ growing needs.  
  
Under the HMSP guidelines, canteen meals which are served as main meals must comprise the 4 main food groups:  

1.  brown rice or wholemeal bread  
    
2.  fruit  
    
3.  vegetables  
    
4.  meat & others  
      
    

In addition, HPB also organizes culinary training for the school canteen vendors to equip them with knowledge of healthy nutrition and culinary skills to prepare healthier meals using healthier ingredients.  
  
Parents can thus be assured that their children in school are eating meals or snacks which are healthier. The school hopes to enlist the support of parents to extend the eating habits are home. To help parents have a better understanding of the guidelines, a copy of the “Healthy Food Happier Children” prepared by HPB is attached for parents’ easy reference. Alternatively, you can access more information on HPB website:  [http://www.hpb.gov.sg/](http://www.hpb.gov.sg/)

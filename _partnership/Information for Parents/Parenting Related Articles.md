Here are some articles containing research findings and useful tips on parenting. The articles can be accessed at the links provided below. We hope you find the articles useful in your own parenting journey!

##### USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT PRIMARY EDUCATION IN SINGAPORE

##### Character & Citizenship Education: Keep Singapore Clean Movement in Schools

*   As part of MOE’s efforts in promoting Values-In-Action (VIA), a “Keep Singapore Clean Movement in Schools” was launched by Minister for Education, Mr Heng Swee Keat, in Jun 2014.  All students are encouraged to propose ideas to keep the school and neighbourhood clean, put their ideas into action and carry them out on a sustained basis so that these good habits can be internalised.   
    
*   The values of care and responsibility for our environment and community start at home. We hope that parents could join us to encourage your child to keep their environment clean.  You can find out more information on the movement in schools and what students can learn through it.
    

  

##### Using Technology in Education

Our students use technology in a variety of ways to learn. While they are taught cyber-wellness in schools, parents can play a part too by setting a good example at home in the use of technology and play an active role in guiding your child to navigate in cyberspace.  
  
You can build your awareness of the kinds of activities that take place in cyberspace and get involved in the following ways:  

*   Encourage your child to share with you his/ her favourite online websites, things to do and what is cool. Spend time online together doing family activities.  
    
*   Talk to your child about his/her online experiences and discuss about the benefits and risks of the Internet.   
    
*   Reassure your child that it is all right to ask you questions or talk to you if they run into problems with someone online.  
    

  

#### HEALTH RELATED MATTERS

##### Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease

In view of the common occurrence of HFMD among young children, we hope that by sharing this information with you, we can minimize the chance of it spreading through school.

  

Please follow these four steps if you suspect that your child may have contracted HFMD:

  

1.  Take your child’s Temperature (either orally or via the ear).  
    
2.  Look for mouth Ulcers. Ask your child to open the mouth and say  “Ah”. Shine a torch in the mouth and look for ulcers on the tongue, inner sides of the mouth and on the lips.
3.   Look for blisters on the Hands. Ask your child to hold out the hands and show his/her palms. Look for small pinkish/reddish bumps or tiny blisters with fluids.Then check for the same on the back of the hands.
4.  Look for blisters on the Feet. Check for bumps/blisters on the upper part of the feet first then the soles.

  
  

We seek your support and co-operation in helping us ensure a clean and safe environment for your child.

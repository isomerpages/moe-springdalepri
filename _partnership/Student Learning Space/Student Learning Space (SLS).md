As part of its commitment to nurturing future-ready learners, the Ministry of Education (MOE) had announced that all students in Singapore schools will be supported in their learning by the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources and learning tools. 

With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of technology. Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere and at their own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers will also be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching, further enriching students’ learning experience.

The school will be assigning structured Home-Based Learning (HBL) assignments via the SLS portal. It will be set for students once termly. Teachers would also be using the platform to set additional work or post additional resources for the students that are relevant to what they are learning. Parents can encourage their children to make use of the contents in the portal to do revision on the topics they have learnt or self-learning for the topics that they are going to learn.

Accessing the site regularly help the students familiarise themselves with the navigation of the portal. In the event of emergency school closure, the portal will be one of the points through which the school will deploy its learning content to ensure continuity of lesson. A computer and internet connection is required for pupils to access the SLS portal.

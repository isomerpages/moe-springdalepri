Language learning is a dynamic and ongoing process. In early childhood, the focus is on developing the childrens’ listening and speaking skills.

The Starlight Programme in MK is an active and interactive approach to help nurture childrens’ interest in learning languages. 

Language learning is made fun for the children through the use of a rich variety of resources such as **Big Books, songs and games** set in the local context. 

Through the programme, your child will develop listening, speaking and early literacy skills&nbsp; which will help lay a strong foundation for language learning in later years.

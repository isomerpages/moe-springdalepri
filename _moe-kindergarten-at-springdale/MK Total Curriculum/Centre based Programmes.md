##### Terrific Thursdays

On the last Thursday of each month, we would celebrate the childrensâ€™ birthday. The birthday babies will don their home clothes and have cake for their snack. On this day, the children will also be introduced a new Value and partake in activities relating to the value that was taught.

##### Mother Tongue Day
Mother Tongue Day is a program designed to create an immersive environment where students can learn and appreciate the different Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures. Children will be exposed to the respective ethnic languages (Chinese, Tamil, and Malay) through music and movement and a range of activities relating to the topic for that year.

The Primary Science Syllabus aims to provide students with opportunities/experiences to:

•	build on their interest and stimulate their curiosity about themselves and their environment.<br>
•	acquire basic scientific concepts to help them understand themselves and the world around them.<br>
•	develop skills, dispositions, and attitudes for scientific inquiry.<br>
•	apply scientific concepts and skills in making responsible decisions.<br>
•	appreciate how science influences people and the environment.<br>
Guided by the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Science Curriculum Framework, our science curriculum aims to equip our students with scientific literacy and instill in them the sense of curiosity so that they may continue to be inspired by science, inquire like scientists, and innovate using science. <br>

**Programmes**

**(1)**&nbsp;&nbsp;**Learning Alive! – Augmented Reality enhanced Inquiry-Based Learning**

Augmented Reality (AR) has enormous potential in learning and is recognised as an emergent technology in education. AR affords scaffolds for students to experience and observe virtual phenomenon and processes as part of their present environment. AR opens more possibilities to create problem scenario.

The school adopts&nbsp;the use of a framework built on Questioning, Investigating, Making and Synthesising (QIMS) to scaffold the learning process. Our AR enhanced inquiry based learning packages allows our students to delve deeper into the learning of Science.

**(2) T(h)inkering with S.T.E.M Learning**  

Adopting a fun, creative and hands-on approach to learning Science, our STEM learning programme involves<br>

•		in-curriculum performance tasks which provide tinkering challenges integrating Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S.T.E.M) learning in our very own Makerspace.<br>
•	Integrated Project Work with Cross-curricular integrations help students better visualize and understand concepts in an enjoyable &amp; engaging manner in real world contexts of problem solving.

**(3)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Enrichment Programmes**

Our enrichment programmes provide opportunities for our students to explore and learn Science in engaging and real-world contexts. These serve to extend and deepen concepts and skills our students are learning in the Science curriculum.<br>
Learning Journey:<br>
•	P3 Our Native Wildlife Digital Learning Journey<br>
•	P4 Heat &amp; Temperature Workshop at The Singapore Science Centre<br>
•	P5 DNA Lab Workshop at The Singapore Science Centre<br>
•	P6 Adaptation Workshop at Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum <br>

Selected P4 &amp; P5 students are also invited to participate in the P4 Excellence 2000 (E2K) programme as well as the Science Olympiad Training Workshops.

**(4)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Eco-stewardship @ SDPS**

Our Eco-stewardship activities aims to increase students’ awareness and understanding of environmental issues and provide platforms for students to play their part for the environment and express their ideas in advocating eco-friendly practices. We hope to heighten the sense of responsibility and care for Mother Earth in our students. Some green activities to encourage this include recycling and upcycling activities, the Clean plate campaign and the National Youth Upcycling Movement (NYUM).  Environmental education is also imbued in Values-In-Action programmes at various levels.

**(5)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Science X-perience Week**

Themed as ‘Igniting the Spirit of Innovation through STEM’, this exciting week brings about showcasing of experiments and works by students. Some activities include Science busking, toy design, show-and-tell competition, and demonstration of STEM projects. From the science busker demonstrations, outstanding teams are invited to participate in the Singapore Science Buskers competition organised by the Science Centre Singapore.

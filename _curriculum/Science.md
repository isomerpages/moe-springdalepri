**Programmes**

**(1)**&nbsp;&nbsp;**Learning Alive! – Augmented Reality enhanced Inquiry-Based Learning**

Augmented Reality (AR) has enormous potential in learning and is recognised as an emergent technology in education. AR affords scaffolds for students to experience and observe virtual phenomenon and processes as part of their present environment. AR opens up more possibilities to create problem scenarios which may be ordinarily limited, especially in the teaching of natural phenomenon.

The school adopts&nbsp;the use of a framework built on Questioning, Investigating, Making and Synthesising (QIMS) to scaffold the learning process. Our AR enhanced inquiry based learning packages allows our students to delve deeper into the learning of Science.

**(2) T(h)inkering with S.T.E.M Learning**  

Adopting a fun, creative and hands-on approach to learning Science, our STEM learning programme involves

\-          Recess activities (Maker’s Monday, Science games café)

\-          in-curriculum performance tasks which provide tinkering challenges integrating Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S.T.E.M) learning in our very own Makerspace

\-          Young Scientist Badge online which is a self-directed platform for tinkering opportunities

\-          Integrated Project Work with Cross-curricular integrations help students better visualize and understand concepts in an enjoyable & engaging manner in real world contexts of problem solving

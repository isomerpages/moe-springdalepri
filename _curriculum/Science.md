The Primary Science Syllabus aims to provide students with opportunities/experiences to:

•	build on their interest and stimulate their curiosity about themselves and their environment.<br>
•	acquire basic scientific concepts to help them understand themselves and the world around them.<br>
•	develop skills, dispositions, and attitudes for scientific inquiry.<br>
•	apply scientific concepts and skills in making responsible decisions.<br>
•	appreciate how science influences people and the environment.<br>
Guided by the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Science Curriculum Framework, our science curriculum aims to equip our students with scientific literacy and instill in them the sense of curiosity so that they may continue to be inspired by science, inquire like scientists, and innovate using science. <br>

**Programmes**

**(1)**&nbsp;&nbsp;**Learning Alive! – Augmented Reality enhanced Inquiry-Based Learning**

Augmented Reality (AR) has enormous potential in learning and is recognised as an emergent technology in education. AR affords scaffolds for students to experience and observe virtual phenomenon and processes as part of their present environment. AR opens more possibilities to create problem scenario

The school adopts&nbsp;the use of a framework built on Questioning, Investigating, Making and Synthesising (QIMS) to scaffold the learning process. Our AR enhanced inquiry based learning packages allows our students to delve deeper into the learning of Science.

**(2) T(h)inkering with S.T.E.M Learning**  

Adopting a fun, creative and hands-on approach to learning Science, our STEM learning programme involves<br>

•		in-curriculum performance tasks which provide tinkering challenges integrating Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S.T.E.M) learning in our very own Makerspace.<br>
•	Integrated Project Work with Cross-curricular integrations help students better visualize and understand concepts in an enjoyable &amp; engaging manner in real world contexts of problem solving.

**(3) Enrichment Programmes **

The Earth is our home. It is everyone’s responsibility to take good care of it. Thus our Go-Green programme includes raising students’ awareness and understanding of environmental issues, so that it will heighten their sense of responsibility and care for Mother Earth. Some activities to encourage this include working on various green activities such as vertical gardening and recycling of plastic bottles and textbooks. Environmental education is also imbued in Values-In-Action programmes at various levels. Moreover termly talks and activities on anti-littering, waste minimisation and the 4Rs help our students in understanding the role they have to play in sustainability and caring for the environment.

**Explicit Instruction for Component /Task Mastery**

Besides STELLAR, a structured programme is also in place to help our students develop and master the various language skills. The strategies for each language component or techniques for each task will be explicitly taught by our teachers to ensure students have a strong grounding in the fundamentals of English. In-house learning packages are also designed to develop students’ skills in writing and oral communication in a progressive manner.

##### WOW@Springdale Programme  
  

Visiting the school library, World of Wonders (WOW) , is one regular language activity at Springdale Primary School. To promote passion for reading and to entrench this habit of reading in our students, curriculum time has been set aside for students to engage in various reading activities like uninterrupted reading period, book talk and library visits.  
  

##### Learning Support Programme (LSP) for English

This programme provides learning support for students who enter Primary 1 with weak English Language and literacy skills. Students are identified for LSP through a systematic screening process carried out at the beginning of Primary 1. The students will be equipped with basic literacy skills so that they could access learning in the regular classroom.

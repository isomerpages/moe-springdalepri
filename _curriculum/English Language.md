#### Confident and Proficient Users of the English Language who enjoy learning

The Springdale Learning Experience (SLE) is guided by our educational philosophy of Play, Passion and Purpose. Our English Curriculum leverages the 3Ps (Play.Passion.Purpose.) to design learning experiences that motivate and meet students’ needs; and involve students as active participants.

At SDPS, we adopt the Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR), a national pedagogic framework, in the learning of the English Language. The STELLAR approach seeks to build strong fundamentals by weaving the areas of language learning through a whole part whole approach where students enjoy reading, viewing, writing and listening to different literature. 


#### Key Programmes

In line with the fast changing educational landscape, our programmes gives attention to multiliteracies, metacognitive skills and exploratory talk in order to help our students achieve 21st century competencies across all areas of language learning.

##### Read &amp; Grow @SDPS  
  
We believe that our students have to be concerned citizens who are cognisant of what is happening around them and in the world. Read &amp; Grow @SDPS seeks to heighten our students awareness of current affairs through sharing of news happenings and getting our students to take different perspectives with the thinking routine – I see, feel, think and wonder.

#### Literacy Support Programmes

**Learning Support Programme (LSP) for English**

LSP aims to provide early intervention for selected P1 and P2 students. It equips students with basic literacy skills to aid their learning in the regular classroom. Conducted by a trained Learning Support Coordinator, these lessons are conducted in small groups daily during school curriculum hours. 


**School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR)**

The SDR programme provides support for selected P3 and P4 students. During this programme, students learn strategies to cope with reading. The lessons are conducted thrice a week after school by a trained SDR instructor.


**Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)**

RRP provides extended reading support for P3 and P4 students. Through a range of strategies for reading comprehension, these students gain greater confidence in managing their learning during their EL lessons. The lessons are conducted twice a week after school by a trained RRP instructor.


**Readers Delight** 

Readers Delight seeks to enthuse our young readers in reading through age-appropriate stories. These sessions are conducted after school weekly for selected students. The small group setting and guided reading allow these students to gain greater confidence in reading and expressing themselves.

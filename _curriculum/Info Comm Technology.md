#### **Teaching &amp; Learning**

The ICT department supports the teaching and learning by providing:

1.  the infrastructure that supports students’ learning with ICT tools.
2.  training to equip teachers to design and conduct ICT-facilitated lessons.

  

In line with MOE’s direction for its&nbsp;Master Plan 4, the school focuses on developing its resources (both hardware and software) to support teachers in facilitating their lessons with the aid of ICT tools. ICT in Curriculum seeks to bring about a synergistic delivery of ICT in education outcomes. Different types of ICT tools that are relevant to the lessons will be deployed to support the learning process. As teachers plan for their lesson, they take into consideration the affordances of different technological tools available and consider carefully how these tools will help to achieve the lesson objectives and plan for the type of interactions that happen during the ICT-facilitated lessons. Teachers also have to take into consideration the appropriateness and ease of use of these tools for the learners in their classrooms. For example, in P2, during one of the Chinese lessons, the teachers engage students in learning and reviewing some Chinese characters and hanyu pinyin using Chinese Characters First Step mobile app. In another English class in P5, teachers enhance students’ understanding of an English text through an online tool, Kami. The school encourages the use of a variety of tools that are relevant to the lesson planned. Teachers are supported by ICT mentors in the crafting of ICT-facilitated lessons.

In order to move towards better engagement during these ICT-facilitated lessons, P1 students will go through structured touch-typing programme to equip them with the basic skill that will enable them to use ICT tools more effectively as they progress to upper levels.

Besides being used to enhance the delivery of teaching content, ICT is also used for assessment of learning, e.g. PSLE e-Oral for Mother Tongue subjects &amp; PSLE e-broadcast for Listening Comprehension.

#### **Cyber Wellness (CW)**

Our Cyber Wellness (CW) programme is guided by MOE CW Framework. The framework is designed to develop students’ instinct to protect and empower them to take responsibility for their own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles that guide the programme are:  
1\. Respect for Self and Others  
2\. Safe and Responsible Use  
3\. Positive Peer Influence  
  
Our school aims to guide our students to become significant citizens by being responsible digital learners to demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and positive use of technologies while they are online. The programme also aims to train and equip students with the appropriate strategies to manage cyber dangers and be a positive influence to their peers.  
  
Our CW outreach includes the following:

1.  Form Teacher Guidance Period CW focussed lessons
2.  Just-in-time CW message inculcation
3.  Assembly programme
4.  CW Ambassador programme
5.  Recess programme

#### **Student Learning Space (SLS)**

As part of its commitment to nurturing future-ready learners, the Ministry of Education (MOE) had announced that all students in Singapore schools will be supported in their learning by the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources and learning tools.&nbsp;  

With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of technology. Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere and at their own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers will also be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching, further enriching students’ learning experience.

The school will be assigning structured Home-Based Learning (HBL) assignments via the SLS portal. It will be set for students once termly. Teachers would also be using the platform to set additional work or post additional resources for the students that are relevant to what they are learning. Parents can encourage their children to make use of the contents in the portal to do revision on the topics they have learnt or self-learning for the topics that they are going to learn.

Accessing the site regularly help the students familiarise themselves with the navigation of the portal. In the event of emergency school closure, the portal will be one of the points through which the school will deploy its learning content to ensure continuity of lesson. A computer and internet connection is required for pupils to access the SLS portal.&nbsp;

To ensure that no child is disadvantaged and every child has access to a computer &amp; broadband internet connection at home, the government is providing subsidy to low-income households to acquire them at an affordable price through the NEU PC Plus Programme.

#### DEPARTMENT PROGRAMMES

  
**Character & Citizenship Education**<br>
In Springdale Primary School, we are committed to nurture students of good character so that they can develop to be secure individuals, leaders of self-worth and significant citizens of tomorrow.  
  
**Department Programmes**<br>
The school’s Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) department have put in place the following programmes & initiatives:   
  

*   **Behaviour Management**<br>
With the establishment of school rules & routines, the teachers play an important role in enforcing positive behaviour in the students. In Springdale Primary, we uphold the philosophy of ‘Discipline with dignity, management with care’. When correcting students’ behaviour, it is important to reinforce school values and help students see how they can put values into actions. It is also of utmost importance that teachers restore students’ self-confidence in the process of correcting students’ behaviour.  
      
    
*   **Social-Emotional Management**<br>
		The school provides care for students with social-emotional &/or special learning needs through individualised sessions conducted by our in-house Allied Educators for counselling and for learning and behavioural support respectively. They spend one-to-one session with these students to equip them with coping skills to overcome their challenges.  
      
    
*   **Student Leadership**<br>
    Our Student Leadership development incorporates the cultivation of values and dispositions and this includes the following:
    
    1.  self-awareness and understanding of others
    2.  having a set of sound values and perspective-taking skills
    3.  good organization skills
    4.  ability to embrace and manage change
    
    The school’s approach to student leadership training is to expose students to lead self, empower them to lead their peers, engage them to lead school and they excel to become leaders of leaders.  
    
    The school will expose all students to pursue self-mastery on this journey towards self-leadership. Leadership traits will be teased out from CCE & FTGP lessons as well as the Values Education talks during Assembly to help students learn the art of leading self before they can lead others.
    
    The school will also empower student leaders to perform their roles with needed guidance from the Teachers. Leadership training will be conducted for selected Primary 3 Prefects during the leadership camp in March.
    
*   **Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)**<br>
The FTGP is conducted by both Form and Co-Form Teachers with MOE resources to equip students with social-emotional competencies to help them appreciate different perspectives, value the feelings of others and learn to better relate to their peers. Parental involvement is encouraged through parents’ participation in the Family Time Activities that are part of the syllabus.  
    
*   **Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**<br>
		Social-emotional skills taught during Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) are reinforced and demonstrated in the weekly PAL lessons for the Primary 1 and 2 students. These lessons are conducted by both Form and Co-Form Teachers. The PAL programme consists of various modules, namely I Can Module, Visual Arts, Performing Arts, Outdoors Education and Sports & Games.

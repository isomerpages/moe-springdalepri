##### Art Framework    

The Learning Outcomes of the Art curriculum are organised by levels in 2-year blocks and according to the cognitive and artistic development of the students. The objectives of the syllabus are achieved through the framework of **See**, **Express** and **Appreciate**. The three behavioural domains of seeing, expressing and appreciating take into consideration the cognitive, affective and psychomotor dimensions that students are involved in when learning art. This ensures that students are provided with opportunities to observe their environment, generate ideas, create artworks, discuss about art and value the role of art in society.

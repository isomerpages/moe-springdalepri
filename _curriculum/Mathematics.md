##### The Primary Mathematics Education aims to enable all students to:

1.  acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in Mathematics;
2.  develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and meta-cognitive skills through a Mathematical approach to problem-solving; and
3.  build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics.

To achieve the above-mentioned aims as well as to align to the school's education philosophy of “Play.Passion.Purpose.”, the Mathematics curriculum in Springdale Primary School takes on an exploratory and experiential approach.  
  

### **Programmes**

1.  **Sustained Support for Mathematics (SSM)**  
    Students learn Mathematical concepts through a series of activities that are scaffolded to develop conceptual understanding. The programme hinges on the principles of early success, strong basics and steady progress. The focus is to provide students the experiences to learn from the concrete to the pictorial and then to the abstract stage. Learning experiences involve the use of manipulative, songs, storybooks and daily experiences. Students work with concrete objects during performance tasks so that they are able to make sense of their learning.  
      
    
2.  **Problem-Solving**  
    Routine Problems  
    Students at all levels, starting from Primary 1, are taught the fundamental skills related to problem-solving and these skills are cascaded in progressive developmental stages which are tagged to the topics taught at the various levels.   
      
    Non-routine Problems  
    Students from Primary 3 are taught the different thinking skills and heuristics to help them solve non-routine questions and higher-order thinking questions. Students go through investigative tasks so as to apply the heuristics in solving problems.   
      
    **Speed Sums**  
    At the foundational levels, basic operations and number facts are emphasised. In order for students to be both accurate and quick, they are assessed formatively and regularly through this programme.  
      
    
3.  **Authentic Learning**  
    Through authentic learning experiences in and beyond the classroom, e.g. learning journeys, students are able to appreciate and apply what they have learnt in Mathematics in real-life contexts. It is through these experiences that they are able to reinforce and connect what they have learned in the classroom to real-life applications.

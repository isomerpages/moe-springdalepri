**Aims of Music Education**

The aims of Music Education are as follows:

1.     develop awareness and appreciation for music in local and global cultures.

2.     develop ability for creative expression and communication through music.

3.     provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music.

Music Education is offered to all students in primary schools. It contributes to the quality of students’ holistic education and plays a part in nurturing them to become informed audiences for the arts. Through creating music, singing and playing instruments, students learn to express themselves creatively in different modes. Listening and appreciation skills enable them to respond and engage with new music throughout their lives.

Music is also an integral part of society. It is used to convey cultural and social norms of different societies. Hence, learning music helps to enrich students’ social, cultural and historical awareness.

**Scope of Learning**

To fulfil the aims of Music Education, the syllabus spans across 3 key stages from Primary 1 to 6. Each stage comprises 2 levels which builds upon the competencies from the previous stage(s). The expected knowledge and skills that students should acquire over the 2 years of each stage are detailed in the Learning Outcomes (LO).  All the LO would be taught in an integrative manner, where elements and concepts are learned through active musical experiences, such as music creation, performance as well as movement in music. The display of musical skills draws on students’ learning and understanding of musical elements and concepts during their musical exploration.

LO1: Perform Music in both instrumental and vocal settings, individually and in groups.

LO2: Create Music in both instrumental and vocal settings, individually and in groups.

LO3: Listen and Respond to Music.

LO4: Appreciate Music in local and global cultures.

LO5: Understand musical elements and concepts.

  

The following diagram summarises the approach in which the five LO can be achieved.

**Programmes**

In the musical journey at Springdale, students will develop their skills in **listening and responding, creating and performing.** This will equip them with the musical capacities to express themselves and expand their learning and understanding of musical elements and concepts.

In an academic year for Primary 1 to 4, there will be 2 broad domains:

**Domain 1: Musical Experience**

**Domain 2: Musical Exploration**

  

In Domain 1: Students will develop understanding of the elements and concepts of music (theory rudiments) through various cultures/ genres of music.  There will be opportunities for students to appreciate music and express themselves through voice, instruments and movements.

In Domain 2, students will be able to explore different types of musical instruments and perform ensemble music. In both domains, there will be platforms provided for students to improvise and create with their vocals and musical instruments. Opportunities will also be provided for them to work collaboratively in groups through processes of music creation and performance.

In an academic year for Primary 5 and 6, the broad domain is **Musical Expedition**. In this domain, students will consolidate and apply their understanding of the elements and concepts of music (theory rudiments) through various forms such as voice, instruments, movements and digital media. There will be opportunities for students to appreciate music and express themselves through various cultures/ genres of music.  Opportunities will also be provided for them to work collaboratively in groups through processes of music improvisation, creation and performance.

The following themes and components will be weaved into the School Music Curriculum so as to contextualise students’ acquisition of the music skills and knowledge.
